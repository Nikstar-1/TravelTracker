## Project Title: 

Travel Tracker

## Website Title and Description

Travel tracker allows users to save the destinations where they have been, as well as the restaurants, hotels, and travel destinations, giving a more unique individual view, and can 

allow other users to read through these reviews in order to craft their own travel experience.


## Who is our audience? 

Travellers who want a more authentic experience, to not take a city or country based upon a star, or a number, but from someone else’s experience.

## User Story: 

As someone looking for a holiday

I want to be able to find reviews of a city, restaurant or hotel, with someone else’s comment.

So that I can choose where I want to go, based up on other’s experiences


## What is the problem the product is going to address? 

It will solve the issue of impersonal reviewing and allow people to gain a better understanding of someone else’s experience


## How does the product solve the problem?

Quickly, and effectively by giving the user direct access to a handy tool allowing them to check destinations. 

It allows for a user to search through a database of personal reviews that outline the experiences people have had of a city, hotel or restaurant.


## Motivation

Our Motivation has come from websites such as tripadvisor and expedia.

Being frequent travellers ourselves we felt it would be great to create a similar project - we want to give people a platform to review experiences whilst also helping to credit a 

company for good performance.
